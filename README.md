# Face_detection

Haar cascades for face and eye detection with opencv(cv2).

This code is used to give a visual and playful example of python's expressiveness to freshmen 
starting the MIPI program at Sorbonne University. Through the implementation of Haar cascades
I manage to catch the attention of many students and generally get positive feedback during the 
presentation lecture.

At the end of the semester, I help interested students improve this code to implement more
advanced features (using the geometry and algebra notions they learned during their 
1M001 and 1M002 Courses).
